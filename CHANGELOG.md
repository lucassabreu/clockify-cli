## [Unreleased]

## Changed

- printing duration as "h:mm:ss" instead of the Go's default format,
  because is more user and sheet applications friendly.

## [v0.3.1] - 2020-04-01

## Fixed

- fixed `--no-closing` being ignored
- interactive flow of `clone` was keeping previous time interval

## [v0.3.0] - 2020-04-01

## Fixed

- minor grammar bug fixes

## Changed

- improvements to the code moving interactive logic of the "in" command into `cmd/common.go`
- "in clone" is now interactive and will ask the user to confirm the time entry data before
  creating it.

## [v0.2.2] - 2020-03-18

## Fixed

- the endpoint `workspaces/<workspace-id>/tags/<tag-id>` does not exist anymore, instead the
  `api.Client` will get all tags of the workspace (`api.Client.GetTags`) and filter the response
  to find the tag by its id.

## [v0.2.1] - 2020-03-02

## Fixed

- `clockify-cli report` parameter `--fill-missing-dates`, was not working

## [v0.2.0] - 2020-03-02

## Added

- `clockify-cli report --fill-missing-dates` when this parameters is set, if there
  are dates from the range informed, will be created "stub" entries to better show
  that are missing entries.

## [v0.1.7] - 2020-02-03

## Added

- `api.Client` now supports getting one specific time entry from a workspace,
  without the need to paginate through all time entries to find it (`GetTimeEntry`
  function).

## Fixed

- `clockify-cli report` was not getting all pages from the period, implemented
  support for pagination and to get "all pages" at once into `Client.Log` and
  `Client.LogRange`

## Changed

- updated README, so it shows the `--help` output as it is now

## [v0.1.6] - 2020-02-03

## Fixed

- fixed bug after Clockify's API changed, where `user` and `project` are not
  automatically provided by the "time-entries" endpoint, unless sending
  an extra parameter `hydrated=true`, and `user` is not provided anymore, so
  now we find it using the user id from the function filter

## [v0.1.5] - 2020-01-08

## Fixed
- fixed bug on the `log` commands, where the previews api url is not available
  anymore, now using `v1/workspace/{workspace}/user/{user}/times-entries`
- spelling of some words fixed and improving some aspects of the code

## Changed
